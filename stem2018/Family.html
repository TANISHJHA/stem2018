	<h1>My Family</h1> 
	<h2>My Mom</h2> 
	<p>My mom is the boss of the house. You should never make her angry, or else you can consider yourself dead. But most of the time, my mom is pretty nice to everyone(in my perspective at least). She may be kind of annoying at times, but she is still awesome, most of the time.</p> 
	<h2>My Dad</h2> 
	<p>My dad is not really at home that much because he is always at work. However, whenever he is at home, and is in the kitchen, you can expect a party on your toungue. My dad is the greatest cook that I know. For a person who spends most of his time in front of the computer, he is an amazing cook, and dad.</p>
    <h2>My Brother</h2> 
    <p>Last, and certaintly least is my brother. He... ummmmm(trying to think of posititive adjectives; having trouble). Ha, I'm just joking around. My bro is a grea bro, but I still can't figure out how he went to college without a brain, it's puzzling. Anyway, all jokes aside, my bro really helps me when I need him, and he continues to help me when I need it even in college.</p>
