	<h1>STUFF I LIKE TO DO</h1> 


	<h2>Make Music</h2>
	<p>I like to make music using my Ipad. I have a software that makes music when I place blocks on certain places on a grid. <br></br>The grid has notes along the side of it, so I know what note I am making. I have one published song on Youtube. It's called Rise. It's in the EDM category of Music. <br></br>I like to liste to EDM music more than anything else. I actually don't like music with lyrics. My favorite artists are TheFatRat, Marshmello, and Alan Walker.</p>

    <h2>Play Video Games</h2> 
    <p>I love to play video games. I like to have lots of competition in games, because that's what makes them fun. My mom doesn't really like it when I play video games, byt I don't let that stop me from playing games. My favorite games are Fortnite, and 2k.</p>
