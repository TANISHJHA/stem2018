<h1>Basketball</h1> 
<p>My favorite sport is basketball. I like to play and watch basketball. My favorite team is the New York Knicks:( I play on the travel team for my school in Montgomery NJ. I absolutey hate the Warriors, because they are constantly winning the finals every year. But basketball is stil fun to play.  </p>

<h1>Football</h1> 
<p>I like to play flag football, but I like to watch real football. I especially like to watch the superbowl. I dont have a favorite team, but I hate the Patriots. I was on the Seahawks in my flag football season. We were the lowest seed, but we still won the entire championship.</p>
